            <h2>Importance of Database Security</h2>
            <p align="justify" class="para">
                In this information technology age, it is compulsory for all types of institutions or companies to make avail their information assets online always through databases. Databases are used to provide personnel information, customer information, credit card numbers, financial data and business transactions, etc. The information is very sensitive and highly confidential and must be prevented from disclosure by other competitors and unauthorized persons.
The security of data is crucial not only in business but also in even home computers as personal files, details of bank accounts are difficult to replace and potentially unsafe if they will be in wrong hands. Data destroyed by hazards like floods or fire is just lost but handing it in unethical person will have severe consequences. It is important to define who can access what data, who is allowed and who is restricted, whether passwords are used and how to maintain it, what sort of firewalls and anti-malware solutions to use, how to train the staff and to enforce data security. Database is very crucial to most enterprises at present days; the damage of database will have tragic impact on it. Unsecured systems will make hurt both the company itself and itsclients.
The insecurity of the database can affect not only the database itself, but also the other running systems which have the relationship with that database. The process of an intruder can be first to get access to the poorly safe database, then use strong built-in database characters to get admission to the local operating system. In this way, other trusted systems connecting with that database will be easily attacked by the intruder.

            <h2>Database Security Threats:</h2>
            <p align="justify" class="para">
                Database security begins with physical security for the systems that host the database management system (DBMS). Database Management system is not safe from intrusion, corruption, or destruction by people who have physical access to the computers. Once physical security has been established, database must be protected from unauthorized access by authorized users as well as unauthorized users. There are three main objects when designing a secure database system, and anything prevents from a database management system to achieve these goals would be consider a threat to database security. There are many internal and external threats to database systems. Some of threats are as follows:
                <ol class="lst" align="justify" style=" padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u> Integrity</u></label>:-Database integrity refers that information be protected from improper modification. Modification includes creation, insertion, modification, changing the status of data, and deletion. Integrity is lost if unauthorized changes are made intentionally or through accidental acts. For example, Students cannot be allowed to modify their grades.</li>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u> Availability</u></label>:-Authorized user or program should not be denied access. For example, an instructor who wishes to change a student grade should be allowed to do so.</li>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u> Secrecy</u></label>:- Data should not be disclosed to unauthorized users. For example, a student should not be allowed to see and change other student grades.</li>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u>Denial of service attack: </u></label>:- This attack makes a database server greatly slower or even not available to user at all. DoS attack does not result in the disclosure or loss of the database information; it can cost the victims much time and money.</li>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u>Sniff attack: </u></label>:-To accommodate the e-commerce and advantage of distributed systems, database is designed in a client-server mode. Attackers can use sniffer software to monitor data streams, and acquire some confidential information. For example, the credit card number of a customer.</li>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u>Spoofing attack: </u></label>:-Attackers forge a legal web application to access the database, and then retrieve data from the database and use it for bad transactions. The most common spoofing attacks are TCP used to get the IP addresses and DNS spoofing used to get the mapping between IP address and DNS name.</li>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u>Trojan Horse: </u></label>:-
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u> </u></label>:-It is a malicious program that embeds into the system. It can modify the database and reside in operating system.</li>
                </ol>
                 </p>   
                 <h2>Database Security Countermeasures:</h2>
                 <p align="justify" class="para">
                    To protect the database system from the above mentioned threats. Here are some countermeasures which are as follows:
                    <ol class="lst" align="justify" style=" padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u>Access Control </u></label>:-A database for an organization contains a great deal of information and usually has several users. Most of them need to access only a small part of the database. A policy defines the requirements that are to be implemented within hardware and software and those that are external to the system, including physical, personal, and procedural controls.</li>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u> Flow Control</u></label>:-Flow control provides the flow of information among accessible objects. Flow controls check that information contained in objects does not flow explicitly or implicitly into less protected objects.</li>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u>Encryption </u></label>:-An encryption algorithm should be applied to the data, using a user-specified encryption key. The output of the algorithm is the encrypted version. There is also a decryption algorithm, which takes the encrypted data and a decryption key as input and then returns the original data.</li>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u> RAID</u></label>:-Redundant Array of Independent Disks which protect against data loss due to disk failure.</li>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u> Authentication</u></label>:-Access to the database is a matter of authentication. It provides the guidelines how the database is accessed. Every access should be monitored.</li>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u>Backup </u></label>:-At every instant, backup should be done. In case of any disaster, Organizations can retrieve their data.</li>
                    <!-- <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u> </u></label>:-</li> -->
