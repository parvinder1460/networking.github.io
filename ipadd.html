        <h2>Introduction to IP Address</h2>
        <p class="para" align="justify">
            An IP address (internet protocol address) is a numerical representation that uniquely identifies a specific interface on the network.
IP stands for Internet Protocol and describes a set of standards and requirements for creating and transmitting data packets, or datagrams, across networks. The Internet Protocol (IP) is part of the Internet layer of the Internet protocol suite. In the OSI model, IP would be considered part of the network layer. IP is traditionally used in conjunction with a higher-level protocol, most notably TCP. The IP standard is governed by RFC 791.

        </p>
        <h2>How IP works</h2>
        <p class="para" align="justify">
            IP is designed to work over a dynamic network. This means that IP must work without a central directory or monitor, and that it cannot rely upon specific links or nodes existing. IP is a connectionless protocol that is datagram-oriented., so each packet must contain the source IP address, destination IP address, and other data in the header to be successfully delivered.
Combined, these factors make IP an unreliable, best effort delivery protocol. Error correction is handled by upper level protocols instead. These protocols include TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol, and UDP, which is a connectionless protocol.
Most internet traffic is TCP/IP.

        </p>
        <h2>Why ip address is important to understand</h2>
        <p class="para" align="justify">
Every device that connects to the Internet has its own Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses make it possible, among other things, for computers from different networks to find each other. IP addresses are vital for all Internet-based activities, and yet it's not uncommon that a user doesn't know his computer's IP address or what it's good for.
</p>
        <h2>Types of Ip Address :-</h2>
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px; padding-bottom: 15px;">1Pv4 :- </h3>
        <p class="para" align="justify">
            An 1Pv4 address is a 32-bit address that uniquely and universally defines the connection of a device (for example, a computer or a router) to the Internet.
        </p>
        <hr >
        <p class="para" align="central"><label style="font-weight:bold;">An 1Pv4 address is 32 bits long.</label></p>
        <hr>
        <p class="para" align="justify">
            IPv4 addresses are unique. They are unique in the sense that each address defines one, and only one, connection to the Internet. Two devices on the Internet can never have the same address at the same time. We will see later that, by using some strategies, an address may be assigned to a device for a time period and then taken away and assigned to another device.

On the other hand, if a device operating at the network layer has m connections to the Internet, it needs to have m addresses. We will see later that a router is such a device.
The IPv4 addresses are universal in the sense that the addressing system must be accepted by any host that wants to be connected to the Internet.

        <h2>Binary Notation</h2>
        <p class="para" align="justify">
        In binary notation, the IPv4 address is displayed as 32 bits. Each octet is often  referred to as a byte. So it is common to hear an IPv4 address referred to as a 32-bit address or a 4-byte address. The following is an example of an IPv4 address in binary notation:

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p class="para" align="justify">
            To overcome address depletion and give more organisations access to internet, class addressing was designed and implemented. In this scheme, there are no classes, byt the addresses are still granted in blocks.
            Restriction:
            To simplify the handling of ip address, the internet authorities impose three restriction on class address blocks.
            <ol class="lst" align="justify">
                <li>The address in a block must be contiguous, one after another.</li>
                <li>The number of addresses in a block must be a power of 2(1,2,4,8).</li>
                <li>The address must be evenly divisible  by the number of addresses.</li>
            </ol></p>
            <p class="para" align="justify">
        <img class="imge" src="https://parvinder1460.github.io/networking.github.io/Images/classes.png">   </p>
        <h2>Why is there no IPv5?</h2>
        <p class="para" align="justify">
        There was an IPv5 that was also known as Internet Stream Protocol, abbreviated simply as ST. It was designed for connection-oriented communications across IP networks with the intent of supporting voice and video.
        It was successful at that task, and was used experimentally. One shortcoming that undermined  its popular use was its 32-bit address scheme – the same scheme used by IPv4. As a result, it had the same problem that IPv4 had – a limited number of possible IP addresses. That led to the development and eventual adoption of IPv6. Even though IPv5 was never adopted publicly, it had used up the name IPv5.
