            <h2>Ipv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)</h2>
          
             <p align="justify" class="para">
            
                IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, which identifies devices across the internet so they can be located. Every device that uses the internet is identified through its own IP address in order for internet communication to work. In that respect, it’s just like the street addresses and zip codes you need to know in order to mail a letter.
                The previous version, IPv4, uses a 32-bit addressing scheme to support 4.3 billion devices, which was thought to be enough. However, the growth of the internet, personal computers, smartphones and now Internet of Things devices proves that the world needed more addresses.
                Fortunately, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) recognized this 20 years ago. In 1998 it created IPv6, which instead uses 128-bit addressing to support approximately 340 trillion trillion (or 2 to the 128th power, if you like). Instead of the IPv4 address method of four sets of one- to three-digit numbers, IPv6 uses eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons.
             </p>
            <h2> What are the benefits of IPv6?</h2>
            <p align="justify" class="para">
                <ol class="lst" align="justify" style=" padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u>More Efficient Routing</u></label>:- IPv6 reduces the size of routing tables and makes routing more efficient and hierarchical. IPv6 allows ISPs to aggregate the prefixes of their customers' networks into a single prefix and announce this one prefix to the IPv6 Internet. In addition, in IPv6 networks, fragmentation is handled by the source device, rather than the router, using a protocol for discovery of the path's maximum transmission unit (MTU).<br>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u>More Efficient Packet Routing</u></label>:-More Efficient Packet Processing IPv6's simplified packet header makes packet processing more efficient. Compared with IPv4, IPv6 contains no IP-level checksum, so the checksum does not need to be recalculated at every router hop. Getting rid of the IP-level checksum was possible because most link-layer technologies already contain checksum and error-control capabilities. In addition, most transport layers, which handle end-to-end connectivity, have a checksum that enables error detection.<br>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u>Directed Data Flows</u></label>:- IPv6 supports multicast rather than broadcast. Multicast allows bandwidth-intensive packet flows (like multimedia streams) to be sent to multiple destinations simultaneously, saving network bandwidth. Disinterested hosts no longer must process broadcast packets. In addition, the IPv6 header has a new field, named Flow Label, that can identify packets belonging to the same flow.<br>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u>Simplified Network Configuration</u></label>:- Address auto-configuration (address assignment) is built in to IPv6. A router will send the prefix of the local link in its router advertisements. A host can generate its own IP address by appending its link-layer (MAC) address, converted into Extended Universal Identifier (EUI) 64-bit format, to the 64 bits of the local link prefix.<br>
                    <li><label style="font-weight:bold;"><u>Security</u></label>:-IPSec, which provides confidentiality, authentication and data integrity, is baked into in IPv6. Because of their potential to carry malware, IPv4 ICMP packets are often blocked by corporate firewalls, but ICMPv6, the implementation of the Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6, may be permitted because IPSec can be applied to the ICMPv6 packets.<br>

                <p align="justify" class="para"> To know our current Ip address use the ipconfig command in command prompt.</p>
        <h2>ipconfig</h2>
        <p align="justify" class="para">Displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) settings. Used without parameters, ipconfig displays Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6 addresses, subnet mask, and default gateway for all adapters.</p>

<h2>Subnetting</h2>
          
<p align="justify" class="para">
            Subnetting is the practice of dividing a network into two or smaller networks. It increases routing efficiency, which helps to enhance the security of the network and reduces the size of the broadcast domain.
            IP Subnetting designates high-order bits from the host as part of the network prefix. This method divides a network into smaller subnets.
            It also helps you to reduce the size of the routing tables, which is stored in routers. This method also helps you to extend the existing IP address base & restructures the IP address.
</p>
            <h2> Types of subnet masks are:</h2>
            <p align="justify" class="para">
            <ol class="lst" align="justify" style=" padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>The <b>default Subnet Mask </b> is the number of bits which is reserved by the address class. Using this default mask will accommodate a single network subnet in the relative class.</li>
                <li>A<b> Custom Subnet Mask </b>can be defined by an administrator to accommodate many Network</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <h2>Benefits of Subnetting</h2>
            <p align="justify" class="para">
                <ol class="lst" align="justify" style=" padding-left: 20px;">
               <li>Subnetting divides broadcast domains, meaning that traffic is routed efficiently, improving speed and network performance.</li> 
               <li> A subnet mask ensures that traffic remains within its designated subnet. This reduces major congestion and reduces the load imparted on the network. With sub-networks, less distance needs to be traveled by data packets, enhancing network performance.</li>
                <li>With different subnets within your larger network, you can be more aware of route maps. These will help you to identify potential threats. With subnets, devices will not be able to access the whole network, meaning that companies can dictate which hardware and users have access to more sensitive data. Network security can be boosted.</li>
                <li>Sound organization is crucial within large businesses. This extends to your newtork and routers. With subnetting, companies have full control over their traffic and data packets.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Public and Private Ip</h2>
          
             <p align="justify" class="para">
                There are two types of IP addresses: private and public. Private IP addresses are part of a reusable pool set aside by the Internet Engineering Task Force for individual networks. These include, particularly, addresses beginning with “10.”, “172.16.”, and “192.168.” These IP address are only relevant to your corporate or local area network. To communicate across the Internet, computers need a public IP address. This address is globally unique, so it cannot be the same as any other in the world. Looking up your IP configuration information in Window settings will often return your private address, which cannot be reached through the Internet. You’ll need to use a service to determine your public IP address as assigned by your Internet service provider (ISP).
